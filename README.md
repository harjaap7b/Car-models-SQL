## Examining the data of Car Model store

In this project I will be using SQL and Python libraries to draw out a picture of the data of car model store. We will see what the company can do to get the most out of their investments. We will be looking at the customer data to see what customers spend the most and the least as well as geographical data to see what countries give the best opportunity for growth. This will help draw out an accurate picture of companies statistics.
